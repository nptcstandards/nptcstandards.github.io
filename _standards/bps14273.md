## Abstract
The Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) is a topological model and a standard used to describe the spatial relations of two regions (two geometries in two-dimensions, R2), in Geometry, Point-set topology, Geospatial topology, and fields related to computer spatial analysis. Since the spatial relations expressed by the model are topological they are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling transformations.
