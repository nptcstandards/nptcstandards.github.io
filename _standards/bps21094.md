## Abstract
Information on the ODF standard and how to move your organisation to ODF-compliant document solutions.
    
    The UK government has selected ODF 1.2 as the standard for editable office documents to be used across government. ODF1.2 was selected as the standard for government because it-
    
    allows citizens, businesses and other organisations to share and edit documents with government - and the other way round
    allows people working in government to share and edit documents with each other
    is compatible with a wide range of software
    is a reliable long-term solution for storing and accessing information
    This guidance gives general information on the standard, as well as more detailed information for chief technology officers and government procurement officers.
