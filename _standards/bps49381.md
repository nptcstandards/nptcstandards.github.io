## Abstract
In today’s corporate environment, organisations tend to combine a number of management systems, such as quality, environmental and information security. As a result, many organizations now want to harmonize these systems and where possible, combine the auditing process for each of these.
    
    The cost of failing a management systems audit takes many forms. You could face losing valuable contracts, prized certifications or even experience a decline in operational efficiency. That’s why basing your audits on the principles and guidance provided in the revised international standard BS EN ISO 19011-2011 makes sound business sense.
