## Abstract
The purpose of this document is to establish a core set of User Interface (UI) standards for UK Policing applications. It is essential that new policing systems have well designed user centric interfaces created according to the customer needs. Balancing of the business goals around how users use technology and not creating interfaces based on the technology is key to creating a good application.
