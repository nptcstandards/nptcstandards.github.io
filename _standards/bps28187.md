## Abstract
Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organisation sets about fulfilling its mission.
    In their turn, principles may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively define and guide the organisation, from values through to actions and results.
    Depending on the organisation, principles may be established within different domains and at different levels. Two key domains inform the development and utilisation of architecture:
    • Enterprise principles provide a basis for decision-making throughout an organisation, and inform how the organisation sets about fulfilling its mission. Such principles are commonly found as a means of harmonising decision-making across an organisation. In particular, they are a key element in a successful architecture governance strategy.
    Within the broad domain of enterprise principles, it is common to have subsidiary principles within a business or organisational unit. Examples include ICT, HR, frontline policing & protective services arenas. These principles provide a basis for decision-making within the subsidiary domain and will inform architecture development within the domain. 
    • Architecture principles are a set of principles that relate to architecture work. They reflect a level of consensus across the organisation, and embody the spirit and thinking of existing enterprise principles. Architecture principles govern the architecture process, affecting the development, maintenance, and use of the enterprise architecture.
    Architecture principles may restate other organisational guidance in terms and form that effectively guide architecture development.
