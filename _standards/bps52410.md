## Abstract
      
This standard describes  the information requirements for the content of the digital case file to be transferred by forces to the CPS, Court and Defence for a first hearing.. In addition to this some requirements have been added for both the police and cps systems to ensure that the benefits of the Digital Case File are met. The Digital Case File (DCF) is part of the Criminal Justice System Efficiency Programme (CJSEP) and will provide a new single digital file data requirement defining the initial details/case summary required by the CPS and other parties for a first hearing, in place of one or more of the  MG forms and/or defined by the National File Standard (NFS).
