## Abstract
      
Police forces have a duty to obtain and use a wide variety of information(including personal  information),  in  order  to  discharge  their  
    responsibilities effectively.  They need the support and cooperation of the public in doing so. The purpose of this Code and associated guidance is 
    to assist the police to carry out that.  The Prime Minister is ultimately responsible for the overall security of HMG. He is supported by the Cabinet Secretary, who chairs the Official Committee on Security (SO). Across HMG responsibility for the security of organisations lies with the respective Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and Management Boards.
    
    This Framework describes the Cabinet Secretary and SOâ€™s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG information and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function effectively, efficiently and securely.
