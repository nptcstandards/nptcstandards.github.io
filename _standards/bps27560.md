## Abstract
      
The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) developed the Police Corporate Data Model (CorDM) and associated Corporate XML (CorXML), which were key components of its Information Systems Strategy for the Police Service (ISS4PS) and Information Systems Improvement Strategy (ISIS) programmes.  CorDM and CorXML became obsolete on the closure of the NPIA and the websites were removed.
