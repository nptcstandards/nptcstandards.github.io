## Abstract
Government email administrators should follow this implementation guide to configure email services securely. It describes how to implement encryption and anti-spoofing, and how to pass an assessment to ensure your email service is configured and run in a secure way. Doing these three things will add your domain to a whitelist, which organisations can use to filter inbound and outbound email
