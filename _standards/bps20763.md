        an organization seeking services from service providers and requiring assurance that their service requirements will be fulfilled;
        an organization that requires a consistent approach by all its service providers, including those in a supply chain;
        a service provider that intends to demonstrate its capability for the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements;
        a service provider to monitor, measure and review its service management processes and services;
        a service provider to improve the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services through the effective implementation and operation of the SMS;
