## Abstract
      
The vast majority of UK government business is conducted at the OFFICIAL classification. This includes routine information supporting business operations and services, much of which would have damaging consequences if lost or stolen.
    
    Security at OFFICIAL is achieved through following good commercial practices, using well configured commodity technologies and by people taking personal responsibility and using their judgement more actively.
