## Abstract
Government and industry have worked together to produce a scheme designed to help UK organisations with limited experience of cyber security improve their defences and demonstrate publicly their commitment to cyber security.
    
    As a set of baseline technical controls, the Cyber Essentials scheme has a very wide audience. Organisations large and small, public, private and charitable can all benefit from the provisions set out in the scheme.
    
    The process of certification has been designed to be light weight and easily manageable while at the same time providing a respected standard in cyber security.
