## Abstract
Provides guidance on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 for those organizations that are intending to either
    
    a) implement ISO/IEC 27001 when ISO/IEC 20000‑1 is already implemented, or vice versa,
    
    b) implement both ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 together, or
    
    c) integrate existing management systems based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1.
    
    ISO/IEC 27013-2015 focuses exclusively on the integrated implementation of an information security management system (ISMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and a service management system (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1.
    
    In practice, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 can also be integrated with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.
