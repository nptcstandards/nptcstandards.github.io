### Windows End User Devices

Windows machine should be built in accordance with the National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC) guidelines for [Windows 10
EUD](standards/bps15792.html)

### Non-Windows Devices

Non-windows devices are out of scope but are included here for
informational purposes.

#### Mac End User Devices

Requires Mac OS X 10.10 or later.

#### Android

Requires Android KitKat 4.4 or later version and an ARM-based or Intel
x86 processor.

Office Versions Compatibility
-----------------------------

To work effectively with Office 365, the minimum desktop version that
should be deployed is Office 2016
<https://products.office.com/en-gb/whats-new-office>.

Previous versions may work with Office 365 but offer reduced
functionality and therefore are not suitable for deployment where they
are expected to conform with the National Enabling Programmes (NEP)
Productivity Services requirements.

Deployment
----------

There are a number of considerations for deployment.

### Deployment Methods

There are three possible deployment methods available.

-   []{#user-content-traditional-deployment .anchor}Traditional
    Deployment

> Traditional installation utilises MSI packages. If this method has
> already been used for 2016 installation that is acceptable but the
> methodology should be updated to Click To Run at the next refresh
> cycle.

-   []{#user-content-portal-deployment .anchor}Portal Deployment

> Portal deployment requires Users to be local administrators on their
> machines and therefore should NOT be used for deployment on police
> infrastructure. This option should be turned off on the cloud platform
> so the option is not presented to users when they are logged onto the
> Office 365 cloud.

-   []{#user-content-click-to-run-deployment .anchor}Click to Run
    Deployment

> Click to Run is the best practice deployment method and provides the
> following benefits:
>
> Streaming installation allows Office apps to run almost instantly &
> features load based on usage.
>
> Use Office 365 both online and offline
>
> Compatible with existing Office add-ins, customizations, macros and
> legacy Office file formats
>
> Unobtrusive background updates with central IT control
>
> Support for update testing & push deployment
>
> License assigned to a person not a computer – can run on up to 5
> machines
>
> No Volume License (KMS or MAK concept) required

TODO: Do we need a piece about at home installation?

### Deployment Options

#### Side by Side Deployment

Side by Side deployment enables older versions of Office to be installed
alongside newer and can be used to facilitate transition and to be
proactive with compatibility risks but is not recommended apart from
where there is no alternative and should not be used on a permanent
production basis.

As best practice:

-   There should only be one version of Office installed on a computer
    except during migration scenarios.

-   Earlier versions of Office should be uninstalled as soon as possible
    after migration to the latest version of Office.

-   Earlier versions of Office that are already installed on the
    computer must be either Office 2013, Office 2010 or Office 2007.

-   The versions of Office that are installed must be the same
    architecture. e.g. both installations of Office are 32-bit
    architecture.

#### Shared Machine Deployment

Shared computer activation enables the deployment of Office Pro Plus 365
to a computer used by multiple users in the organisation.

Each User must have their own licenses for Office 365 Pro Plus.

As the licensing token that is stored on the shared computer is valid
only for a few days and requires regular renewal, a shared machine needs
reliable connectivity to the internet and can not be standalone.

The following excerpt must be added to the ODT deployment XML to specify
shared activation.

&lt;Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="True" /&gt;

&lt;Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1" /&gt;

A computer installation may be checked for shared activation in the
following the article:

[Verify that shared computer activation is enabled for Office 365
ProPlus](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-issues-with-shared-computer-activation-for-Office-365-ProPlus-c3aeb487-d45f-4079-8c35-7558a45b876c?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#enabled)

### Additional Components Required

#### Office Telemetry

Office Telemetry is the compatibility monitoring framework. A record is
added to the local cache when a document is loaded, used, closed or
raises an error in certain Office applications.

Subsequently, the record is uploaded to the Office Telemetry database
where the organisation wide data can be viewed and analysed using the
Telemetry Dashboard.

The Telemetry dashboard is provided as an Excel workbook that connects
to the Office Telemetry database and provides pre-built and custom
reports.

The telemetry dashboard should be used to assist in identifying issues
with LOB applications caused by upgrading office both in production and
as part of the upgrade pilot upgrades prior to full rollout.

#### Azure Information Protection (AIP) Client

The Azure Information Protection Client MUST be installed to enable full
integration with Azure Information Protection (AIP). This client
installs the Information Protection bar to Office applications that
enables the classification and labelling, according to \[BPS Security
Classifications & Handling\], of Office created information assets
according to the nationally agreed standards. Labelling according to
national standards then enables nationally accredited policy to be
applied to those documents.

#### Azure Information Protection Viewer

Microsoft Azure Information Protection Viewer lets a user open and view
other protected files in addition to Microsoft Office protected files
that were shared with them:

-   Open and use protected files such as PDF, text files, images and any
    other file format that has a .pfile extension.

-   View permissions, and print or save the file without protection – if
    permission allows.

Viewer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=838993)

Managed Deployment
------------------

Office product and language files should be downloaded to an on-premises
location and then the ODT and configuration deployed to users by using a
software distribution product, such as Microsoft System Centre
Configuration Manager.

The generic process is as follows:

1.  Add users to Office 365 tenant and license for Pro Plus.

2.  Download Office Deployment Tool.

3.  Use setup to download Click To Run packages.

4.  Customize configuration XML.

5.  Add Click To Run Packages to software distribution infrastructure.

6.  Deploy Click To Run packages with setup and XML configuration.

7.  Deploy add ins and customizations.

### ODT Download Configuration

The download configuration is used by the ODT when executed by
administration staff to download the required Office packages to the
network distribution point where they can then be accessed by EUD for
installation or update.

**Add**\
Parent control to determine source, architecture, product and languages
to download.\
From CDN:

&lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

    &lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;

      &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;

    &lt;/Product&gt;

&lt;/Add&gt;

From local network:

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
Version=”15.0.4128.1014” OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

    &lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;

      &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;

    &lt;/Product&gt;

&lt;/Add&gt;

**Product**\
The targeted products to download within the command. Multiple products
may be nested under the control and multiple languages may be nested
under the control.\
Office 365 ProPlus

&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;

  &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;

&lt;/Product&gt;

&lt;Product ID="VisioProRetail"&gt;

   &lt;Language ID=”ja-jp" /&gt;

&lt;/Product&gt;

&lt;Product ID="ProjectProRetail"&gt;

   &lt;Language ID=”es-es" /&gt;

&lt;/Product&gt;

**SourcePath**\
Location where the Office is downloaded to. If unspecified, the
downloaded content will be saved to the folder where the setup.exe is
located, therefore for download the distribution network point must be
specified.

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

**OfficeClientEdition**\
Determines the architecture of the product to download, 32 or 64 bit.
Note: 32-bit is still the recommended architecture for new Office
versions. Cross-architecture installations are not permitted; if a
32-bit Office version is already installed on a system, the 64-bit
Click-to-Run package will not install and vice versa.\
Dependent on whether there is a requirement for 64 bit products then
both editions may be selected for download.

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

Or:

OfficeClientEdition="32"

OfficeClientEdition="64"

**Language**\
Language determines the language DAT files to be downloaded with the
Click-to-Run package.

&lt;Language ID="en-gb" /&gt;

&lt;Language ID="cy-gb" /&gt;

**Version**\
Version is used as part of the control and specifies the version to be
downloaded. If version is not specified, setup.exe will download the
latest build and this is considered best practice.

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

### ODT Install Configuration

The install configuration is used by the ODT when executed on the EUD.
Both tool and configuration should be distributed by the SCCM for ease
of multiple EUD deployment but may be manually applied where required.

*Add*\
Parent control to determine source, architecture, product and languages
to download.

From local network:

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

*SourcePath*\
Location where the Office is installed from. If SourcePath is
unspecified, setup will first look for installation source in the local
folder and if not present it will look to the CDN source. Therefore, a
network SourcePath should be specified to ensure retrieval from
centralized network distribution endpoint.

&lt;Add SourcePath="\\\\Server\\Share\\Office\\"
OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;

Managed Updates
---------------

Update packages are downloaded, by the system administrators, to the
central distribution point which was specified in the SourcePath of the
ODT Installation Configuration at initial install onto an EUD.

Office applications check the SourcePath for the availability of new
packages and download them in the background without any user
intervention required.

Prior to rolling out updates for production, a selection of test users
should be identified whose installations cover the full range of 3rd
party applications and/or add-ins that integrate with Office
applications for compatibility testing.

### Updates Channel

Office products can be updated from different Microsoft channels which
provide different update frequencies. According to NEP national design,
the Microsoft LOOKUP IN LLD channel is the recommended. This applies to
all policing organisations and ensures that the same versions of Office
software are utilised thereby facilitating compatibility not just
locally but nationally. Using nationally agreed versions of Office also
provide pushback onto 3rd party suppliers to keep in line with policing
update policy or be excluded at contract renewal points.

Application Settings Configuration
----------------------------------

Office specific Group Policy settings should be used to create and
enforce standard configurations for users and computers.\
The Click-to-Run and MSI versions of Office products use the same set of
Group Policy settings which should be installed on the on premises
domain servers by copying the .admx and .adml templates into the Group
Policy central store.

Domain GPO usually takes precedence over local policies. If no domain
gpo is applied to the same setting of the local policies then the local
policy won’t get written over and it will still apply.

Office 2016 Administrative Template files are available at [Office 2016
Administrative Template files
(ADMX/ADML)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030)
and must be installed on the on-premises Active Directory Domain Server
to be able to configure group policy for Office 365 for each O365
application.

Several Variations of One drive GPO’s available, there are GPO files
that control the One drive client that’s built into Microsoft Windows 8
/ 10. GPO ADMX files for these are included in the latest Microsoft ADMX
files which can be downloaded from the internet. One drive for business
(Next Gen client) is distributed with Office 2016 and are sourced from
%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\BuildNumber\\adm\\. One drive for
business ADMX files can be found at this link -

3rd Party LOB Compatibility
---------------------------

Where core software, such as Office, are not able to be upgraded or
patched due to the constraints of 3rd Party applications then the
process covering this scenario as specified in \[BPS 30717\] should be
followed to enable pushback on the supplier.

Issue and Resolution Logging
----------------------------

Where any compatibility issues are discovered during a rollout, upgrade
or as the result of Telemetry data then the issue and any resolution
should be logged according to [BPS 89017](../standards/bps89017.html) so
that the information is available for use cross force.
