## Abstract
      
The Information Systems Strategy for the Police Service (ISS4PS) was the overarching IS/ICT strategy for the Police Services in England and Wales published by the Police IT Organisation (PITO) around 2006 (Volume two)
    
    The standard was based on the following principles-
    
        Service Based
        Business Services
        Modularity
        Service Integration
        Common Presentation to Users
        Modern Development Methodologies
        Open Standards
        It adopted many aspects of TOGAF including the Standards Information Base.
