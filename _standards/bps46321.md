## Abstract
      
British APCO has worked with the Cabinet Office, emergency services and commercial organisations to develop a common standard for the sharing of incident information between emergency service control rooms.
    
    The schema was approved in 2016 and is now an adopted open standard for government. The schema can be found HERE.
    
    British APCO will continue to promote and further support the future development of the schema based upon the requirements and needs of the membership which will undoubtedly develop as the schema comes into wider use.  We encourage all suppliers of control room systems to design the standard into their systems and for all users to specify it.
    
    We believe that its widespread introduction will improve the overall efficiency and performance of control rooms and the 999 system itself, enhancing the ability of emergency responders to delivering an effective and efficient service to the public.
