Standards is transitioning into central management under the remit of the Director of Digital and Data at the Police ICT Company.

Standards work occurs over a large group of policing organisations, including the 43 geographic police services and National Programmes. Programmes and Projects can identify or generate Standards but are temporal in nature and once the activity has been completed, those standards need an Organisation that can provide a permanent home for their management and maintenance. With this in mind, and the central positioning of the Police ICT Company with their policing technology convergence strategy, it is a logical choice to assign the function to them.
