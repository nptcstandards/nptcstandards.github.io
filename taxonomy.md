There are many ways that standards can be classified and no one solution will fit all purposes. This page provides guidance on the taxonomy NPTS uses to classifies standards.

# Technical
A technical standard is an established norm or requirement in regard to technical systems. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes and practices

### Specification
Specification (technical standard) ... A requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.

### Data
Data standards are the rules by which data are described and recorded. In order to share, exchange, and understand data, we must standardize the format as well as the meaning

# Business
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.

# Reference
Reference is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object.

# Template
The term template, when used in the context of word processing software, refers to a sample document that has already some details in place; those can be adapted (that is added/completed, removed or changed, differently from a fill-in-the-blank approach as in a form) either by hand or through an automated iterative process, such as with a software assistant.
