title: Taxonomy

There are many ways that standards can be classified, as users will want to view things through different lenses, so no one solution will fit all purposes. 

The method NPTS is currently applying is:

**Key Responsibility Area** > **Document Purpose/Function** > **Asset or Activity** to which the purpose is applied.

The hierarchy can be extended downwards to create greater specificity of the type of asset or activity involved, if required.

Some documents may have content that crosscut the hierarchy and therefore may be tagged in more than one classification.

The taxonomy presented here is a work in progress and will continue to evolve as standards are adopted or developed and added to the catalogue.
