Our purpose is to enable the production of Standards relating to UK Policing requirements that are agreed and accepted by a consensus of stakeholders, using a consistent, repeatable and understood process.

Through adoption of these standards by suppliers, national applications & integration as well as ICT departments, they will assist in delivering:

1.  Easier integration

    Between internal applications, other police forces, partners as well as national applications (HODH, PND, PNC, PLX…)

2.  Data quality

    Improved Data Quality through the integration with the above applications.

    e.g. Selecting valid entries such as PNC ID from the Common Data Platform to use in internal mobile Crime recording 

3.  Joined up Policing

    Better links and analysis to other data sets from a force due to the improved Data Quality.

    e.g. Ability to leverage Biometrics matching on passport pictures

4.  Reduced costs

    Costs of externally procured systems will go down as development is streamlined, reduced integration costs / administration, more competition through a demystified Police market.

    e.g. Interfaces take a fraction of the time as HODH and PND require the same formats, ‘write once’ promoting reuse.

5.  Improved competition

    Increased suppliers in the market due to a better understand that Policing isn’t unique.

    e.g. Increased competition in Command & Control as commercial suppliers realise the requirements and standards are the same in Policing as in other sectors.
    
6.  Faster implementation

    Due to easier integration, less customisation of data capture, easier to link to national systems, easier digital evidence integration etc.

    e.g. Niche implementation would be less customised and a standard project methodology  

7.  Performance reporting – Ability to simplify and produce performance framework as data can be matched and reported on more easily.

    e.g. No need for a separate J track extract for Home Office reporting.

8.  Plug & Play – Ability to plug and play different systems, mobility or portals without the need to integrate.

    e.g. The Met design a mobile app for Threat To Life (TTL) which could be used by any Police force, even though they don’t have the same Records Management System (RMS).

# Scope

The NPTS group is concerned with standards relating to Policing requirements, i.e. those standards where by its’ nature and composition the Police Technology Council and this working group are best positioned to guide.

Discover, identify, collate, consolidate, define, agree and manage Standards for recommended use in policing. 

Adopt existing standards which are available and in use by national bodies and industry. 

Examples of ICT standards can be found in the glossary at the end of this document. 

Function & Products

Working method / ways of working

The NPTS working group will use appropriate tools to communicate and collaborate with one another to achieve the goals set out in this ToR.  
Collaboration tools will be defined by the PTC for all working groups to use where defined.

Appropriate tools identified at present include the following:

1.      Access to collaboration spaces is by invite. <mailto:trustee@standards.police.uk> 

2.      PoliceICT website to be used to link to published standards.

# GSC Marking

It is assumed that all documents although OFFICIAL are NOT sensitive as all documents are intended to be for public consumption when finalised including this ToR.

# Glossary

** Standard **

"In essence, a standard is an agreed way of doing something. It could be about making a product, managing a process, delivering a service or supplying materials – standards can cover a huge range of activities undertaken by organizations and used by their customers.

Standards are the distilled wisdom of people with expertise in their subject matter and who know the needs of the organizations they represent – people such as manufacturers, sellers, buyers, customers, trade associations, users or regulators.

Standards are knowledge. They are powerful tools that can help drive innovation and increase productivity. They can make organizations more successful and people’s everyday lives easier, safer and healthier.

# Examples of Standards

+   In Motion

    To specify interoperable exchange of data.

+   At Rest

    Not in terms of definition but with respect to storage and resilience etc?

## Interface standards

+   Physical

    Such as the point of connection between a device and a computer terminal, are concerned with the compatibility of products.

+   API

    Such as the specification of RESTful services.

+   Protocol

    Including networking specifications.

+   User Experience (UX)

Such as Accessibility etc.

+    Process Standards

     Only with respect to the NPTS. To Specify the process by which standards must be produced and maintained.

+    Product Standards

     Establish qualities or requirements for a product (or related group of products) to assure that it will serve its purpose effectively.

+    Service Standards

Such as establishing requirements to be met in order to achieve the designated purpose effectively.

+    Security Standards

     Security crosscuts a number of concerns and can relate to physical, encryption, over the wire, levels of isolation etc.

+    Terminology Standards (or standardized nomenclature)

     Define words permitting stakeholders to use a common, clearly understood language.

+    Test and Measurement Standards

     Define the methods to be used to assess the performance or other characteristics of a Product or Service.

+    Voluntary Standards

     A voluntary standard imposes no obligation on specified parties to conform to it but is provided as best practice or guidance.
