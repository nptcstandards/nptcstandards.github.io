    RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
    
    RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.
    
    This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

    Government and industry have worked together to produce a scheme designed to help UK organisations with limited experience of cyber security improve their defences and demonstrate publicly their commitment to cyber security.
    
    As a set of baseline technical controls, the Cyber Essentials scheme has a very wide audience. Organisations large and small, public, private and charitable can all benefit from the provisions set out in the scheme.
    
    The process of certification has been designed to be light weight and easily manageable while at the same time providing a respected standard in cyber security.

    Information on the ODF standard and how to move your organisation to ODF-compliant document solutions.
    
    The UK government has selected ODF 1.2 as the standard for editable office documents to be used across government. ODF1.2 was selected as the standard for government because it-
    
    allows citizens, businesses and other organisations to share and edit documents with government - and the other way round
    allows people working in government to share and edit documents with each other
    is compatible with a wide range of software
    is a reliable long-term solution for storing and accessing information
    This guidance gives general information on the standard, as well as more detailed information for chief technology officers and government procurement officers.

    The CJS in England and Wales uses a commonly agreed set of data standards to support ICT communications between the systems used by criminal justice organisations (CJOs). These data standards are designed specifically to support the operation of the CJS. They are to be used with open data standards as defined in the government’s Open Standards Principles. The government’s open standards are selected by the Cabinet Office standards hub.
    
    Common data standards are used by CJOs, their ICT suppliers and potential suppliers wishing to bid for CJS contracts. They are also used to support the data analytics of criminal justice information.
    
    These standards are available to the public under the Open Government Licence.
    
    The selection of the CJS data standards is made by the CJS Data Standards Forum. This is a technical forum which has representatives from the principal CJOs.

    British APCO has worked with the Cabinet Office, emergency services and commercial organisations to develop a common standard for the sharing of incident information between emergency service control rooms.
    
    The schema was approved in 2016 and is now an adopted open standard for government. The schema can be found HERE.
    
    British APCO will continue to promote and further support the future development of the schema based upon the requirements and needs of the membership which will undoubtedly develop as the schema comes into wider use.  We encourage all suppliers of control room systems to design the standard into their systems and for all users to specify it.
    
    We believe that its widespread introduction will improve the overall efficiency and performance of control rooms and the 999 system itself, enhancing the ability of emergency responders to delivering an effective and efficient service to the public.

    Implementation of Good Practice Guide 13 is a strong recommendation for all HMG ICT Systems, and is essentially compulsory for systems that store high impact level data.
    
    The goal of a Protective Monitoring system is to ensure that there is a level of operational insight, to ensure that organisations have an understanding of how their IT systems are being used or abused by internal or external agents.

    This document provides UK Policing with a methodology to security, accreditation and risk management which has been designed as an enabler to The UK Policing Vision 2025.
    In addition to defining an approved methodology to follow, this document also provides appendices of predefined useable baseline product inputs to be leveraged by other policing projects to reduce the time and effort involved in performing their required risk management and assessment work. The predefined material is based on the actual risk work that was executed on behalf of the National Enabling Programmes (NEP) to allow it to achieve accreditation on its’ projects.

    This standard describes  the information requirements for the content of the digital case file to be transferred by forces to the CPS, Court and Defence for a first hearing.. In addition to this some requirements have been added for both the police and cps systems to ensure that the benefits of the Digital Case File are met. The Digital Case File (DCF) is part of the Criminal Justice System Efficiency Programme (CJSEP) and will provide a new single digital file data requirement defining the initial details/case summary required by the CPS and other parties for a first hearing, in place of one or more of the  MG forms and/or defined by the National File Standard (NFS).

    OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. The OData protocol is comprised of a set of specifications for representing and interacting with structured content. The core specification for the protocol is in [OData-Protocol]; this document is an extension of the core protocol. This document defines representations for the OData requests and responses using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), see [RFC4627]. OData RESTful APIs are simple to consume. The OData metadata, a machine-readable description of the data model of the APIs, enables the creation of powerful generic client proxies and tools.

    Police forces have a duty to obtain and use a wide variety of information(including personal  information),  in  order  to  discharge  their  
    responsibilities effectively.  They need the support and cooperation of the public in doing so. The purpose of this Code and associated guidance is 
    to assist the police to carry out that.  The Prime Minister is ultimately responsible for the overall security of HMG. He is supported by the Cabinet Secretary, who chairs the Official Committee on Security (SO). Across HMG responsibility for the security of organisations lies with the respective Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and Management Boards.
    
    This Framework describes the Cabinet Secretary and SO’s expectations of how HMG organisations and third parties handling HMG information and other assets will apply protective security to ensure HMG can function effectively, efficiently and securely.

    In practice, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 can also be integrated with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.

It applies to any organization (private, governmental, and non-governmental, irrespective of size) developing its ICT readiness for business continuity program (IRBC), and requiring its ICT services/infrastructures to be ready to support business operations in the event of emerging events and incidents, and related disruptions, that could affect continuity (including security) of critical business functions. It also enables an organization to measure performance parameters that correlate to its IRBC in a consistent and recognized manner.

    In today’s corporate environment, organisations tend to combine a number of management systems, such as quality, environmental and information security. As a result, many organizations now want to harmonize these systems and where possible, combine the auditing process for each of these.
    
    The cost of failing a management systems audit takes many forms. You could face losing valuable contracts, prized certifications or even experience a decline in operational efficiency. That’s why basing your audits on the principles and guidance provided in the revised international standard BS EN ISO 19011-2011 makes sound business sense.
