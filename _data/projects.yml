    In addition to defining an approved methodology to follow, this document also provides appendices of predefined useable baseline product inputs to be leveraged by other policing projects to reduce the time and effort involved in performing their required risk management and assessment work. The predefined material is based on the actual risk work that was executed on behalf of the National Enabling Programmes (NEP) to allow it to achieve accreditation on itsâ€™ projects.
