The NPTC STndards Working group is a small core team of people providing coordination and authoring in the huge Policing standards space. As such, we can not peform all the work alone and neither would we want to as Standards should be created, adopted and agreed by a process of collaboration and consensus. See our [framework](framework.html) documents for how we operate.

If you work within policing you will no doubt have material that can be contributed to standards that will be of benefit to other police services. We would like to hear from you.

You may see the need for a particular Standard in the course of your work and think that it should be added to our [Backlog](backlog.html) for future development. We would like to hear from you.

If you work within the private sector, Standards enable you to develop systems and services for policing that are compliant with what policing requires. You may also have material that you feel could be input help form the basis of new standards that could be of benefit to policing. We would like to hear from you.

Standards help everybody.
